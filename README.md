## Description
Welcome to *The Lords of Chaos*, a unique blend of text adventure and roguelike gameplay set in a procedurally generated world of utter chaos. Built with Vite, React, Redux, and Ant Design, this game invites players to "Enter the Chaos Dimension" where reality is a fluid concept.

In this chaotic universe, nothing makes sense. Your quest? To find the Reality Stone. But beware, obtaining it only reveals that you've moved a layer in an intricate web of chaotic realities.
